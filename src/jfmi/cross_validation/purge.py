    This function purges (removes) training set samples whose information windows
    overlap with the testing set. Trades are typically structured with triple-barriers.
    If the vertical barrier (end time) of a training set sample overlaps with the
    testing set, then you're peeking at the future. See below for more information:

            A series (both sets) of vertical barriers, with a DatetimeIndex of
            start (prediction) times and a column of Timestamp end (closing) times (i.e,
            when the label becomes observable).
        sr_test_bounds:
            Testing set bounds of a similar structure, but for the entire dataset. If
            it's contiguous, then this series can be a single row.

    Returns:
        A series of training set samples of the same structure.
